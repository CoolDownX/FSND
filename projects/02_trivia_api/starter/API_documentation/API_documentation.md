# Introduction

This API was built to fullfill the requests from the UDACITY-Trivia game and to feed it with real data from a connected database.
Users can access different questions within five categories and submit new questions within the given categories.
The user can further delete questions and use the play mechanics which are shown within Trivia-API-game.
You will find further details on this, later in this specification.

# Getting started

To learn how to set up the local development environment, I will refer to the provided ```Readme.md```-files within the Project structure.
You can find these in: 
* ``` /frontend ```
* ```/backend ```

## Base URL

The base URL is the following: ``` http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ``` or ``` http://localhost:5000/ ```.
With this endpoint, you will only recieve a "welcome"-message and success set to ```True``` but no further data.

The response should look like this:
``` JSON
{
     "message": "Welcome! You are requesting the Trivia-API",
     "success": true
}
```

# HTTP - Responses

The API follows the typical ```HTTP``` convension of response codes.
What errors may occur while using the API, can you see in the list below.  

For further details on requesting endpoints please read through the chapter: **Endpoints**

# Endpoints

This Chapter is about using the endpoints and provides always an example ```Curl-Request``` which is formatted to use it on ```Windows ``` and the associated JSON-Object from the response. 

Please note that all lists of questions within the response are **limited to 10** due to pagination. 
To access further data, set the ```?page=1``` - argument to another number. 

The JSON-Objects which are shown below contain only 2 entries of Lists from category and questions to keep it readable.
The real responses will contain more data.
